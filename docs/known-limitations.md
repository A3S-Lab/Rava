# Known Limitations

This document tracks known limitations and edge cases in the Rava compiler and runtime.
It reflects the **verified** state of the code, not aspirational goals.

## Execution model (important)

Rava has two execution paths that share one IR (RIR):

- **`rava run` / `rava test` → RIR interpreter** (`crates/micrort`). This is the **mature,
  supported path**: 409/409 end-to-end Java tests pass. Treat this as the product today.
- **`rava build` → Cranelift AOT** (`crates/codegen-cranelift`). This is **experimental** —
  it compiles only a subset of programs and miscompiles several basics (see below).

`cargo test --workspace` completes and is green (~500 passing, 14 AOT tests quarantined).

## AOT backend (`rava build`) — experimental

- **Loops are miscompiled into infinite loops.** A trivial `for (int i=1;i<=5;i++) sum+=i;`
  produces a native binary that never terminates. Affects `for` / `while` / `do-while` /
  `break`/`continue` / loop-bearing switch. Tests quarantined with `#[ignore]` in
  `crates/codegen-cranelift/tests/aot_e2e.rs`.
- **Generic classes segfault.** Field access on a generic class crashes (exit 139). Root
  cause: a global, flat field-slot map in `translator/mod.rs` (no per-class slots). Test:
  `aot_generic_pair` (`#[ignore]`).
- **Exceptions don't unwind.** `throw` lowers to `trap`/abort; there is no try/catch/finally
  unwinding in AOT.
- **Narrowing casts are silently dropped.** `Convert` is a no-op — `(int)longValue` does not
  truncate, causing silent data corruption.
- **`NewMultiArray` only allocates the first dimension.**
- AOT covers only basic OOP/arithmetic; collections, streams, lambdas, String methods,
  StringBuilder, and most of the standard library are **not** supported in AOT yet. These all
  work on the interpreter path.
- `rava build --target` supports `native` only. `jar`, `jlink`, `docker` are not implemented.

## Optimization passes (`crates/aot/src/passes.rs`)

- Escape analysis, dead-code elimination, and constant folding have real implementations.
- **Inlining is analysis-only** — it identifies candidates but performs no inlining.
- **Escape analysis results are not applied** — nothing is stack-allocated yet.
- **MetadataTableGenPass is scaffolded**: function-pointer resolution, field offsets, real
  method signatures, and superclass extraction are TODO; the table is not embedded in the
  binary. `ProxyPregenPass` (Phase 4) and `MicroRtBridgePass` (Phase 3) are empty stubs.

## Compiled `.class` execution (bytecode → RIR)

`rava run File.class` and **`rava run File.jar`** execute pre-compiled Java by lowering its JVM
bytecode to RIR and running it on the existing interpreter
(`crates/micrort/src/{classfile,bytecode}.rs`); output matches the JVM. A JAR's `.class` entries
are loaded into one module so cross-class calls link (`bytecode::load_jar`/`load_classes_module`).
**Supported subset:** int/long/float/double arithmetic + conversions + bitwise/shifts, control
flow + loops, **booleans and (nested) ternaries / short-circuit `&&`/`||`** (values that cross a
basic-block edge on the operand stack are spilled to / reloaded from locals), static/virtual/special
calls + recursion, objects/fields/constructors (incl. cross-class), arrays, `String` + library
method calls (routed to builtins), `System.out.println` (incl. `println(boolean)` → `true`/`false`),
stack ops (`dup`/`swap`/…), `checkcast` (lenient, like the interpreter's casts), `throw`,
`try`/`catch`, `switch` (`tableswitch`/`lookupswitch`), **string concatenation** (`invokedynamic`
`makeConcatWithConstants`), interface dispatch (`invokeinterface`), and **lambdas / method
references** — both **non-capturing** (LambdaMetafactory → method-ref value) and **capturing**
(closures that close over locals; javac lifts captures into leading params, packed into a
`__bclosure__` heap object that prepends them at invoke time). **Not yet:** `instanceof`, and
catching *library* exceptions (catch matches by class name — user exception types work; built-in
types like `ArithmeticException` need name normalization). The common JVM instruction set is now
covered. The separate JVM-bytecode VM in `interpreter.rs` remains an unused stub — the
bytecode→RIR path supersedes it.

The README's MicroRT "dynamic Java" escape hatch (dynamic reflection / proxy / class loading, JNI)
is still **aspirational — not implemented**.

## Interpreter semantics (verified via differential testing vs OpenJDK 17)

The interpreter matches OpenJDK 17 across a large differential-tested corpus. The remaining
gaps below are tracked; the first two stem from value representation and are deferred because a
fix is invasive and risks regressing the e2e suite:

- **`int` arithmetic does not wrap at 32 bits.** Integers are held as 64-bit, so
  `Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1` yields `2147483648` instead of Java's `-2147483648`. Programs that
  rely on 32-bit overflow (hashing, checksums) will differ.
- **`char` in arithmetic context concatenates instead of promoting.** `char` is represented as
  a 1-char string, so `int sum = 0; sum += someChar;` concatenates rather than adding the code
  point. Use an explicit `(int)` cast as a workaround. A proper fix needs a distinct char type.
- **`finally` blocks do not run when the `try`/`catch` body `return`s** (they run on normal
  fall-through). High-priority correctness bug.
- **Mixed-type ternary / numeric widening on assignment**: `double d = cond ? 1 : 2.5;` keeps
  the `int` branch as `1` rather than widening to `1.0`. Assigning an int literal to a declared
  `double` is not coerced.
- **Records** generate the canonical `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and accessors, so they
  have value semantics: `r1.equals(r2)`, records as `HashMap`/`HashSet` keys, and set dedup all work
  by component values. (Object map/set keys generally now compare by `toString` value, not identity —
  so any class with a meaningful `toString` works as a key; classes without one stay identity-based.)
- **Enums**: `name()`/`ordinal()`/`values()`, `switch` on enums, custom methods, constructor
  fields, and display via `println`/concat/`printf %s` all work. Still missing: `Enum.valueOf(name)`
  (returns nothing) and `Arrays.toString(EnumType.values())` (shows `Type@id` — array-of-objects
  stringification doesn't reach the per-element `toString`; use `printf`/a manual loop instead).
- `IntStream.summaryStatistics()` is not implemented (the accessor calls — `getSum`/`getAverage`/…
  — are lowered down a path that can't read the result object's fields). Use `sum()`/`average()`/
  `min()`/`max()` directly, which work.
- Explicit reference casts do not throw `ClassCastException` on a bad cast (the cast is a no-op
  in the interpreter).

## Toolchain

- **Dependency resolution is wired into `rava run`, not `rava build`.** `rava run <jar>` now
  auto-loads every dependency JAR named in `rava.lock` (downloading any not yet cached) onto the
  classpath — no manual `-c` needed. You can also pass dependency JARs explicitly with
  `-c lib1.jar,lib2.jar`. The AOT path (`rava build`) still does **not** download or link JARs.
  Whether a real Maven JAR actually *executes* depends on bytecode coverage (`instanceof` and
  library-exception catch normalization are the main remaining gaps — see below).
- **Transitive POM resolution is partial.** `pom::parse_pom_dependencies` +
  `registry::resolve_closure` resolve transitive deps for POMs that declare versions literally
  or via same-POM `${...}` properties, filtering test/provided/optional. They do **not** yet
  resolve **parent POMs**, `<dependencyManagement>`, or BOM imports — so a dependency whose
  version is inherited from a parent (common: Jackson, Spring) is skipped rather than guessed.
- CLI commands mentioned in the product vision (`lint`, `repl`, `publish`, `doctor`,
  `upgrade`, `export`) are not implemented. Implemented: `run`, `build`, `init`, `add`,
  `remove`, `update`, `deps`, `test`, `fmt`.
- Fully-qualified references to builtin types (e.g. `java.util.List.of(...)`) do not resolve;
  use the simple name (`List.of(...)`). Builtins are keyed by simple name.
